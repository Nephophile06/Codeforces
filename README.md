# Codeforces Practice Problem Solutions
Welcome to my personal repository of **Codeforces** problem solutions!  
I created this repo alongside my [beecrowd](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/beecrowd) one as I started my competitive programming journey. 🌱

## 📌 About
This repository includes solutions to problems I've solved on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), written in **C++**.  
I started storing them to keep track of my learning and improvement.

📝 **Overview of the Repository Structure:**

- Simple and beginner-focused approach (started from 800 rating)  
- Emphasis on understanding logic and writing clean, readable code  
- All files are placed directly in the root — named like `problem 'problemNumber' - 'ProblemName'` 

## 🧾 Problem Format
Each file is named like:

```
problem 1030A - In Search of an Easy Problem
problem 1221B - Knights
...
```
